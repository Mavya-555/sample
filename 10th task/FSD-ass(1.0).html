<h1>HTML</h1>
<p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and it is used to create webpages. It uses HTML tags and attributes to describe the structure and formatting of a web page.
HTML consists of various elements, that are responsible for telling search engines how to display page content. For example, headings, lists, images, links, and more.</p>
<p>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to create web pages. 
Itâ€™s a combination of Hypertext, which defines the link between web pages, and Markup language, 
which is used to define the text document within tags to structure web pages. 
This language is used to annotate text so that machines can understand and manipulate it accordingly.
 HTML is human-readable and uses tags to define what manipulation has to be done on the text.
