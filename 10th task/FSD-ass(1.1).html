<h1>CSS</h1>
  <P>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language designed to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. 
It allows you to apply styles to HTML documents, describing how a webpage should look by prescribing colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning.
 CSS provides developers and designers with powerful control over the presentation of HTML elements.

HTML uses tags and CSS uses rulesets. CSS styles are applied to the HTML element using selectors.
 CSS is easy to learn and understand, but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document.
</P>
  <p>CSS consists of style rules that are interpreted by the browser and applied to the corresponding elements. 
A style rule set includes a selector and a declaration block.</p>The selector points to the HTML element that you want to style.
The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.
Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.
CSS declaration always ends with a semicolon, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.
 In this example, all paragraph element (p tag) will be centre-aligned, with a blue text color.
