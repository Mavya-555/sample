<h1>HTML</h1>	
<p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and it is used to create webpages. It uses HTML tags and attributes to describe the structure and formatting of a web page.
HTML consists of various elements, that are responsible for telling search engines how to display page content. For example, headings, lists, images, links, and more.</p>
<p>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to create web pages. 
Itâ€™s a combination of Hypertext, which defines the link between web pages, and Markup language, 
which is used to define the text document within tags to structure web pages. 
This language is used to annotate text so that machines can understand and manipulate it accordingly.
 HTML is human-readable and uses tags to define what manipulation has to be done on the text.
</p>
<p>Every HTML document begins with a document type declaration, setting the foundation for the webpage. 
This section introduces basic HTML tags that structure the page.Although this is not mandatory, 
it is a good convention to start the document with the below-mentioned tag.
Below mentioned are the basic HTML tags that divide the whole page into various parts like head, body, etc.</p>
  <p>The HTML heading tags are used to create headings for the content of a webpage. These tags are typically placed inside the body tag. 
HTML offers six heading tags, from h1 to h6, each displaying the heading in a different font size.</p>

<h1>CSS</h1>
  <P>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language designed to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. 
It allows you to apply styles to HTML documents, describing how a webpage should look by prescribing colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning.
 CSS provides developers and designers with powerful control over the presentation of HTML elements.

HTML uses tags and CSS uses rulesets. CSS styles are applied to the HTML element using selectors.
 CSS is easy to learn and understand, but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document.
</P>
  <p>CSS consists of style rules that are interpreted by the browser and applied to the corresponding elements. 
A style rule set includes a selector and a declaration block.</p>The selector points to the HTML element that you want to style.
The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.
Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.
CSS declaration always ends with a semicolon, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.
 In this example, all paragraph element (p tag) will be centre-aligned, with a blue text color.

<h1>JavaScript</h1>
  <P>JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, single-threaded, and interpreted compiled programming language.
 It is also known as the scripting language for webpages. It is well-known for the development of web pages, 
and many non-browser environments also use it.

JavaScript is a weakly typed language (dynamically typed). JavaScript can be used for Client-side developments as well as Server-side developments. 
JavaScript is both an imperative and declarative type of language. JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, like Array, 
Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements like operators, control structures, and statements. 
</P>
  <p>It was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich while he was an engineer at Netscape. It was originally going to be named LiveScript but was renamed. 
Unlike most programming languages, JavaScript language has no concept of input or output. It is designed to run as a scripting language in a host environment, 
and it is up to the host environment to provide mechanisms for communicating with the outside world. The most common host environment is the browser. </p>
